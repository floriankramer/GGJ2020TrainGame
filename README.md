# TrainAction3K

Picture

Train Action 3K is a game in which you have to maintain your train so it never stops. Unfortunately it is constantly getting damage and you have to repair the slowly breaking parts in order to achieve the longest distance. The items which are needed for the repair jobs, are spawned along the tracks, and it is even possible to save some for later on one of the wagons. Obstacles on the tracks are causing extra damage.

## How to play
Tutorial picture

  1. Get as far as you can with your train. It takes damage on the way and you will need to repair it in order to make it
  2. The damage of five different goups of parts is shown here for both the train and the waggon. If one group of parts is completely broken at the waggon, it's lost. If one group of the train is completely broken the journey ends.
  3. Collect items and use them as spare parts to repair your train
  4. Store items that you don't need at the moment in your waggon for later repair jobs
  5. Be aware of obsticles in your way - destroy them before the further damage your train
